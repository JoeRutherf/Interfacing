Description: The package has the function stable_marriage that finds a set of stable marriages between two
	     preference tables by the Fundamental Algorithm. It does this by using inputs thare are two lists 
             of vectors. 
	     The package also contains the function other_stable_marriage that does the same but with inputs 
	     that are two lists of vectors and two other vectors. 
             The function rcpp_marshall_unordered_dictionaries performs marshalling by transforming a list
	     of vector of strings as an unordered dictionary.
	     The function rcpp_marshall_vector_list performs marshalling by transforming a vector of strings 
	     and a list of vector of strings to an unordered dictionary.
